## Exercise 2: Configure Security Policies

# What are security policies, initiatives, and recommendations?

Microsoft Defender for Cloud applies security initiatives to your subscriptions. These initiatives contain one or more security policies. Each of those policies results in a security recommendation for improving your security posture.
## What is a security policy?
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/policy-reference#microsoft-defender-for-cloud-initiatives

An Azure Policy definition, created in Azure Policy, is a rule about specific security conditions that you want controlled. Built in definitions include things like controlling what type of resources can be deployed or enforcing the use of tags on all resources. You can also create your own custom policy definitions.

To implement these policy definitions (whether built-in or custom), you'll need to assign them. You can assign any of these policies through the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI. Policies can be disabled or enabled from Azure Policy.

There are different types of policies in Azure Policy. Defender for Cloud mainly uses 'Audit' policies that check specific conditions and configurations then report on compliance. There are also "Enforce' policies that can be used to apply secure settings.

Defender for Cloud offers the following options for working with security initiatives and policies:

View and edit the built-in default initiative - When you enable Defender for Cloud, the initiative named 'Azure Security Benchmark' is automatically assigned to all Defender for Cloud registered subscriptions. To customize this initiative, you can enable or disable individual policies within it by editing a policy's parameters. See the list of built-in security policies to understand the options available out-of-the-box.

The initiatives group lists the Azure Policy initiative definitions in the "Defender for Cloud" category.
The default initiative group lists all the Azure Policy definitions that are part of Defender for Cloud's default initiative, Azure Security Benchmark. This Microsoft-authored, widely respected benchmark builds on controls from the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with a focus on cloud-centric security.
The category group lists all the Azure Policy definitions in the "Defender for Cloud" category.
For more information about security policies, see Working with security policies. For additional Azure Policy built-ins for other services, see Azure Policy built-in definitions.

The name of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azure portal. Use the link in the Version column to view the source on the Azure Policy GitHub repo.

Add your own custom initiatives - If you want to customize the security initiatives applied to your subscription, you can do so within Defender for Cloud. You'll then receive recommendations if your machines don't follow the policies you create. For instructions on building and assigning custom policies, see Using custom security initiatives and policies.

Add regulatory compliance standards as initiatives - Defender for Cloud's regulatory compliance dashboard shows the status of all the assessments within your environment in the context of a particular standard or regulation (such as Azure CIS, NIST SP 800-53 R4, SWIFT CSP CSCF-v2020). For more information, see Improve your regulatory compliance.

## Exercise 3: Secure Score 

What is a Secure Score?
As you must have known by now that the azure security center has two goals :

It helps you understand your current security situation.
It helps you improve your security situation by giving recommendations.
A secure score is a way to achieve your goal: the higher the score, the lower the risk level.

To improve the percentage, review Security center recommendations for the pending actions. Proposals also include steps to follow to achieve the goal.

Secure Score
How is the Secure Score Calculated?
Each recommendation has some points assigned to it. If you apply that recommendation, the score will automatically increase. Each proposal will have a maximum score and current score, as shown in the figure.

Score Calculation 
Few formulas are used by azure to calculate the score, which you as a user donâ€™t need to worry about. You need to follow the security recommendations provided by the Azure Security Center.
Overview of secure score
Microsoft Defender for Cloud has two main goals:

to help you understand your current security situation
to help you efficiently and effectively improve your security
The central feature in Defender for Cloud that enables you to achieve those goals is the secure score.

Defender for Cloud continually assesses your cross-cloud resources for security issues. It then aggregates all the findings into a single score so that you can tell, at a glance, your current security situation: the higher the score, the lower the identified risk level.

In the Azure portal pages, the secure score is shown as a percentage value and the underlying values are also clearly presented:

## Access and track your secure score
You can find your overall secure score, as well as your score per subscription, through the Azure portal or programmatically as described in the following sections:
Get your secure score from the portal
Defender for Cloud displays your score prominently in the portal: it's the first main tile the Defender for Cloud overview page. Selecting this tile, takes you to the dedicated secure score page, where you'll see the score broken down by subscription. Select a single subscription to see the detailed list of prioritized recommendations and the potential impact that remediating them will have on the subscription's score.

To recap, your secure score is shown in the following locations in Defender for Cloud's portal pages.

In a tile on Defender for Cloud's Overview (main dashboard):

## Get your secure score from Azure Resource Graph

Azure Resource Graph provides instant access to resource information across your cloud environments with robust filtering, grouping, and sorting capabilities. It's a quick and efficient way to query information across Azure subscriptions programmatically or from within the Azure portal.

To access the secure score for multiple subscriptions with Azure Resource Graph:

From the Azure portal, open Azure Resource Graph Explorer.

- In the Azure mobile app, the secure score is shown as a percentage value and you can tap the secure score to see the details that explain the score:
To increase your security, review Defender for Cloud's recommendations page and remediate the recommendation by implementing the remediation instructions for each issue. Recommendations are grouped into **security controls**. Each control is a logical group of related security recommendations, and reflects your vulnerable attack surfaces. Your score only improves when you remediate *all* of the recommendations for a single resource within a control. To see how well your organization is securing each individual attack surface, review the scores for each security control.

For more information, see [How your secure score is calculated](secure-score-security-controls.md#how-your-secure-score-is-calculated) below.
## Manage your security posture

On the Security posture page, you're able to see the secure score for your entire subscription, and each environment in your subscription. By default all environments are shown.

It also shows how many unhealthy resources and how many recommendations exist in your environments. |

The bottom half of the page allows you to view and manage viewing the individual secure scores, number of unhealthy resources and even view the recommendations for all of your individual subscriptions, accounts, and projects.

You can group this section by environment by selecting the Group by Environment checkbox.

## How your secure score is calculated

The contribution of each security control towards the overall secure score is shown on the recommendations page.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33771500/187209833-1e21a86b-5459-4b81-a907-108c45d00794.png)
To get all the possible points for a security control, all of your resources must comply with all of the security recommendations within the security control. For example, Defender for Cloud has multiple recommendations regarding how to secure your management ports. You'll need to remediate them all to make a difference to your secure score.
